# Computational_modeling_for_cognitive_science

***This repository contains portfolio assignments, which were done during the Computational modeling for cognitive science course as part of Cognitive Science BA´s degree at Aarhus University***

***Teacher: Riccardo Fusaroli & Fabio Trecca (Eye-tracking workshop)***


***Instructor: Kenneth Christian Enevoldsen***


***2020 spring semester***



## About the course

In this course we start again from the foundations of statistical thinking: What is like to build a model? How do our expectations and previous knowledge shape and constrain models? How do we assess whether our models are any good and where they fail? We adopt a Bayesian framework implemented in Stan (R-packages rethinking and brms), since this approach makes it easier to build your own models and make your assumptions explicit. During the course we cover the generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) framework, but the course prepares you to go beyond this, via additional online materials and/or in the bachelor thesis.

## Portfolio assignments

File ```Experimental_methods_3_Portfolio.pdf``` contains a compilation of written reports solving the assignments listed below. ```Assignments code``` folder contains rmd and md files displaying the code solving the assignment.

| Assignment | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio 1: Eye-tracking data analysis | Preprocesing and analysing eye-tracking data collected in a lab during a Foraging experiment and Social engagement experiment |
| Portfolio 2: Evaluating the Cognitive science knowledge of Cognitive science teachers | Assessing rates from a binomial distribution, using the case of assessing our teachers’ knowledge of CogSci |
| Portfolio 3: Causal_Inference | Exploring some issues related to multiple regressions (regressions with more than one predictor), and inferred (causal) relations between variable while utilizing Bayesian modeling. Diagnosing schizophrenia from multiple symptoms, utilizing  causal graph method (Directed Acyclical Graph) to investigate the questions. |
| Portfolio 4: The role of priors and cumulative science | Running a Bayesian meta-analysis of pitch variability in ASD, based on previously published literature, analyzing pitch variability in ASD in two new studies using both a conservative and a meta-analytic prior, assessing the difference in model quality and estimates using the two priors.|
