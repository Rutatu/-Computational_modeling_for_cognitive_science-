## About the course

In this course we start again from the foundations of statistical thinking: What is like to build a model? How do our expectations and previous knowledge shape and constrain models? How do we assess whether our models are any good and where they fail? We adopt a Bayesian framework implemented in Stan (R-packages rethinking and brms), since this approach makes it easier to build your own models and make your assumptions explicit. During the course we cover the generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) framework, but the course prepares you to go beyond this, via additional online materials and/or in the bachelor thesis.
